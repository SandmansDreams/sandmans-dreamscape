	<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Sandman, but you can also call me Gabriel the Angel or Gabe (not my real name). I am sort of a Jack-of-all-trades, doing coding, writing, art, music, etc. My main focuses right now is on music and coding. I can't wait to share all the stuff I am working on with you!</p>
	<p>This site will contain a lot of things:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Projects I am working on or have finished</li>
		<li>Tools I have made (with UI) or code snippets</li>
		<li>Articles or posts about things I want to talk about or deem important</li>
		<li>Some fun web stuff that I thought would be cool</li>
		<li><SecretText text="Secrets, and perhaps even an ARG"/></li>
		<li>And much more!!!</li>
	</ul>
